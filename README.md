# Branch `native-front-to-anchor-program`
- [x] Clean deps and upgraded anchor
- [x] Fixed joke account length
- [x] Added creation date
- [x] Sort jokes by creation date 
- [x] Added both anchor and non anchor clients

⚠️Branch `native-front-to-anchor-program` is not compatible with the deployed version, I might do a migration or
deploy the program with a different address.


# UX
- [ ] Display V2 or V3 or give a selector
- [ ] We should follow network of the wallet, when switch network?
- [ ] You are not on devnet
- [ ] Switch to mainnet
- [ ] Airdrop sol (devnet/testnet)
- [ ] Create KP?
